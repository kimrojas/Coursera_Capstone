    "&nbsp;&nbsp;**1.1.\t Background** <br />\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According the latest *NYC&amp;Company* release New York City welcomed about 65.2 million tourists in 2018 year - 51.6 million domestic and 13.5 million international visitors. And these numbers are continuously increasing from year to year.<br/>\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New York City has the largest selection of lodging choices in the country – from the hostels to the luxury hotels. <br/>\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prices vary from 100$ till several thousand dollars with average price of 292 USD per night.   <br/>\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hotel Occupancy rate is also high – in 2018 year it was 88%<br/>\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visitors prefer short stays that are often over weekends - averaging 2.4 nights.\n",
    "<br/> <br/> \n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;**1.2.\t Problem** <br/>\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In New York City there are almost 300 hotels with over 75,000 hotel rooms and Airbnb has more than 50,000 apartment listings in New York City in 2018 year - it can be hard to find the right fit or know how much you will get with your money. <br />\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this project we will try to find the most optimal borough in Manhattan where a tourist can rent an accommodation via Airbnb service and have a pleasant stay in NYC and a possibility to attend the most visited attractions like Central Park, Times Square  and so on.\n"
